# wk1-refactor-challenge

## Description

This project involved refactoring a website for a company called Horiseon, who specializes in digital marketing, to make it more accessible. 

The aim is to improve the search engine optimization of the website and enhance the user experience for people with disabilities.

During this project, I learnt the importance of version control using GitHub and also how to apply semantic elements to an HTML file.

* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
